# Introduction:
Detroit, the largest city in Michigan, has a population of over 670,000 people and is known as the automotive capital of the world. The city has a rich history, including being a hub for music and culture, but has also faced challenges such as urban decay and crime. One potential solution to these challenges is improving walkability in the city, which can make it safer, more attractive, and more accessible for residents and visitors alike. The walkability project presented on this GitHub page aims to analyze and visualize walkability in Detroit and provide recommendations for improving pedestrian infrastructure in the city. The project uses a variety of tools, including Python, Pandas, ArcGIS, HTML, CSS, and JS, to clean, process, analyze, and visualize data related to walkability in Detroit.

# How These Tools Can Be Beneficial to the City of Detroit:
The tools used in this walkability project can be beneficial to the City of Detroit by providing valuable insights into pedestrian infrastructure and potential areas for improvement. The use of Python and Pandas can help to clean and process large datasets related to walkability, while the use of ArcGIS can provide sophisticated spatial analysis and visualization capabilities. The use of HTML, CSS, and JS can help to create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore data related to walkability in Detroit. By presenting these insights to the City Council, urban planners, and other stakeholders, this project can help to make a compelling case for investing in walkability in Detroit, and provide specific recommendations for how to do so. Ultimately, improving walkability can make Detroit a safer, more attractive, and more accessible city for all residents and visitors.

The link provided leads to an interactive web map created using the ArcGIS platform. The map shows the city of Detroit, Michigan and its walkability heat index, which is a measure of the walkability of different areas of the city. The heat index is based on a variety of factors, such as the presence and quality of sidewalks, the availability of crosswalks, and the proximity of amenities such as shops, restaurants, and public transportation.

The heat index is visualized on the map using a color gradient, with areas of higher walkability shown in darker shades of green and areas of lower walkability shown in lighter shades of green or yellow.

# Conclusion
The walkability project analyzes and visualizes walkability in Detroit and provides recommendations for improving pedestrian infrastructure in the city, can be a powerful tool for promoting positive change in the city. The use of Python, Pandas, ArcGIS, HTML, CSS, and JS allows for the cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing of data related to walkability in Detroit, which can be presented to the City Council, urban planners, and other stakeholders. This project can help to make a compelling case for investing in walkability in Detroit, and provide specific recommendations for how to do so, ultimately making the city a safer, more attractive, and more accessible place for residents and visitors. The tools used in this project can provide valuable insights into pedestrian infrastructure and potential areas for improvement, which can help to create a more sustainable and livable Detroit for years to come.
