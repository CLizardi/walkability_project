# Introduction:
Detroit's walkability project presented on this GitHub page aims to analyze and visualize walkability in the city and provide recommendations for improving pedestrian infrastructure. To achieve this goal, the project uses a variety of tools, including Python, Pandas, ArcGIS, HTML, CSS, and JS to clean, process, analyze, and visualize data related to walkability in Detroit. The original dataset used in the project was obtained from the website https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index. By leveraging these tools, the project can provide valuable insights into pedestrian infrastructure and potential areas for improvement, which can help make Detroit a safer, more attractive, and more accessible city for all residents and visitors. With its rich history as a hub for music and culture, improving walkability in Detroit can help to address challenges such as urban decay and crime and create a more sustainable and livable city for years to come.

# How These Tools Can Be Beneficial to the City of Detroit:
The tools used in this walkability project can be beneficial to the City of Detroit by providing valuable insights into pedestrian infrastructure and potential areas for improvement. The use of Python and Pandas can help to clean and process large datasets related to walkability, while the use of ArcGIS can provide sophisticated spatial analysis and visualization capabilities. The use of HTML, CSS, and JS can help to create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore data related to walkability in Detroit. By presenting these insights to the City Council, urban planners, and other stakeholders, this project can help to make a compelling case for investing in walkability in Detroit, and provide specific recommendations for how to do so. Ultimately, improving walkability can make Detroit a safer, more attractive, and more accessible city for all residents and visitors.

The link provided leads to an interactive web map created using the ArcGIS platform. The map shows the city of Detroit, Michigan and its walkability heat index, which is a measure of the walkability of different areas of the city. The heat index is based on a variety of factors, such as the presence and quality of sidewalks, the availability of crosswalks, and the proximity of amenities such as shops, restaurants, and public transportation.

The heat index is visualized on the map using a color gradient, with areas of higher walkability shown in darker shades of green and areas of lower walkability shown in lighter shades of green or yellow.

# HTML Presentation
Using the information gathered from this project, we created an HTML report that summarizes our findings and provides specific recommendations for improving pedestrian infrastructure in the city. The report can be accessed at http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CLizardi/walkability_project/blob/main/Walkability%20Project/walk.html. This report showcases how the tools used in this project can be beneficial to the city of Detroit by providing valuable insights into pedestrian infrastructure and potential areas for improvement. By investing in walkability, Detroit can become a safer, more attractive, and more accessible city for all residents and visitors.

# Conclusion
The walkability project analyzes and visualizes walkability in Detroit and provides recommendations for improving pedestrian infrastructure in the city, can be a powerful tool for promoting positive change in the city. The use of Python, Pandas, ArcGIS, HTML, CSS, and JS allows for the cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing of data related to walkability in Detroit, which can be presented to the City Council, urban planners, and other stakeholders. This project can help to make a compelling case for investing in walkability in Detroit, and provide specific recommendations for how to do so, ultimately making the city a safer, more attractive, and more accessible place for residents and visitors. The tools used in this project can provide valuable insights into pedestrian infrastructure and potential areas for improvement, which can help to create a more sustainable and livable Detroit for years to come.
